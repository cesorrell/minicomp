  three of the chiefs came to point caguay to wait on the General, our party remainde
  with the rest of negroes, with whome I question not but wee shall agree very well,
  they are to being their wives and children to remain amongst us for security: major
  Fairfax is gone to them with another party to make conditions with them. they promised
  to carry our men where the Spainish governor quarters and to bring him in, wee are
  now soe intermixed with them and having possession of all their provisions that
  should they offer to do back wee can with ease destroy them wich doth much encouradge

  when once they may settle to work without fear of an enemy, which I pray God may
  bee effected for I haved set up my homested for some years nd fear not but to gods
