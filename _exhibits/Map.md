Colonial officials estimated around three to four hundred enslaved people transformed their rural settlements in the southern coastal lowlands into three major Palenques ––Vermajales, Palenque de Río Juana, and Palenque de Porrus. While the viceroy ordered Governor Ysassi to promise freedom to those who submitted and fought on behalf of the crown, the governor withheld and hesitated to grant the Palenques legal freedom due to their desire to maintain their separated status and the complaints raised by their former owners who fled to Santiago de Cuba who desired not to lose possession over their former enslaved captives. Instead, the Palenques and governor Isasi maintained a mutual military alliance. On the other hand, this political arrangement raised questions amongst English and regional Spanish Imperial administrators about the Palenques’ status, their loyalties, and whether they should be granted freedom as they vied for control over the island. This map shows the location of each of the aforementioned Palenques.
