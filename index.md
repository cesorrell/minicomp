During the English conquest of 1655, the island’s Palenques’ (Black fugitive Maroon settlements) occupation of the montes reached the center of competing Imperial discussions about the island’s governance, conquest, and restoration. That year, the English launched their first and largest state-backed transatlantic expedition ever attempted to seize all of Spain’s American possessions. 
conscripted maroons and Black free and enslaved militias foiled the armada’s initial strike on Hispaniola, narrowed the scope of the campaign, and stalled its renewed attempt to seize Jamaica for over half a decade. In Spanish Jamaica, these Black communities leveraged their occupation of the montes, shifting between loyalties, to secure a sovereign space. On their part, Spanish officials endeavored to retain their loyalty as claimed vassals of the crown, while English officials pursued them as potential auxiliary allies against their former overlords. This database brings together original primary sources from Imperial Archives in Spain and the United Kingdom to capture a glimpse into this brief yet crucial moment in the Early Modern Caribbean.
